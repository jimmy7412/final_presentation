## Notes

### Script

#### Opening



#### Problems

Landslides are a serious issue throughout the world, the picture is of the Oso landslide in washington State where 43
people died on March 22, 2014. 

#### Metrics

As the actual cost of property damage can be difficult to assess world wide, combining reported injuries and fatalities
to get a casualty metric was used a proxy for overall cost. 

Natural Language Processing was used to try to predict casualties, by breaking out the descriptions and some other 
descriptive categorical columns in the data. 

The R^2 metric is used as a descriptor of success, that is one minus residual squared error over total squared error
The equation is on a later slide.

The picture is a recent picture of MT ST Helens, which erupted on May 18, 1980, which started with an earthquake caused
landslide then an eruption and pyroclastic flow.

#### Approaches



Talk about the process and cleaning and analyzing the data


#### Models

Talk about the difficulty in using the models.

#### Performance

The models did not perform up to expectations

#### Impact

If it worked specific word could be pulled out and used to analyze descriptors.
